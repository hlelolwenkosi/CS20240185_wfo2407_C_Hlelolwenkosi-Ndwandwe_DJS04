In this project, I focused on improving the structure of the Book Connect application by analyzing the existing code, simplifying repetitive sections, and implementing abstraction through the use of objects and functions. By defining objects for books, authors, and genres, I made it easier to manage the data, while creating dedicated functions streamlined tasks like rendering the book list and handling user interactions. Throughout the process, I ensured that the application remained fully functional, allowing users to search for and view books without issues. I also added clear comments for better documentation and followed coding conventions to maintain readability and organization. This experience not only enhanced my understanding of JavaScript and web development but also made the code more enjoyable to work with. Despite facing challenges, particularly in simplifying certain functions, I learned valuable problem-solving skills and am proud of the outcome.
