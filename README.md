Working with Web Components was a great experience that improved my coding skills and understanding of modular design. I appreciated how reusable components made the codebase cleaner and more organized. The learning curve was steep, but the outcome was satisfying. Overall, this project taught me valuable lessons about component design, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills to future projects. I look forward to exploring more complex interactions within Web Components and enhancing my web applications further.
